            <li>1 teaspoon chopped onions</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>For assembling the Krabby Patties</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>4 sesame seed hamburger buns, toasted</li>
            <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
            <li>¼ cup yellow mustard</li> 
            <li>8 lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>1 roma tomato, sliced</li>
            <li>½ medium red onion, sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup dill pickle slices</li>
            <li>1 package crispy seaweed snacks or chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                Preheat your stove-top griddle or an extra-large skillet over medium-high heat and lightly spritz with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>Place ground beef in a medium bowl, add the ramen seasoning, and, using your hands, thoroughly combine.
            </li>
            <li>Divide the ground beef mixture into 4 even balls and, once the griddle has preheated, transfer to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Sear the burger balls, uninterrupted, for 1 minute before using the back of a spatula to flatten them into patties. Continue to cook on that side for 2-3 minutes until nicely browned, then flip. Cook the other side for 2-3 minutes or until the desired doneness has been reached.
            </li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low (or remove the pan from heat) and top the burgers with slices of cheese. Set aside to melt while you prepare the special sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Place mayonnaise, relish, seafood seasoning, turmeric, and vinegar in a medium bowl, and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>To assemble your Krabby Patties, dollop the bottom burger bun with approximately 1 tablespoon each of ketchup and mustard. Dollop the top bun with a heaping tablespoon of the special sauce and evenly spread to cover.</li>
            <li>Place the burger patties on the dressed bottom bun and top with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, and 1-2 seaweed chips (in that order). Secure your burgers with toothpicks, and serve immediately.</li>
